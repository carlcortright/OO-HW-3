# OO-HW-3

This assignment was done by Matt Niemiec, Mehmet Karaoglu, and Carl Cortwright. It was done in Python3. In order to run the program, simply go to the command line, navigate to the appropriate folder, and type "python3 storesim.py config.json" as the command line argument feeds in the config file. Other than this, there are no special instructions to running the code. Thank you!
